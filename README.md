# Capstone Project 1: H-1B Predictions


### Introduction

International students (non-US citizens / non Green Card holders) must hold a valid work visa to legally work in the United States. Among various types of visas sponsored by the US
government, H-1B is the most popular form of work visa. The approval process however is quite
stringent, with higher ratio of applicants getting their application denied over the years. Through this dataset, I
aim to understand if there are certain unique features that can predict which applicants eventually get approved for the H-1B visa.
